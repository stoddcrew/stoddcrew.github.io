      <h2>Safety Equipment</h2>
        <article>
          <h3>Helmets</h3>
            <p>
              Wearing a helmet is the <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/bike-program/rules-of-the-road" target="_blank">law</a>! In the event of an accident you will be much more likely to avoid serious head and brain injury while wearing a helmet.  Also, wearing a helmet sets a great example for your children while keeping your head warm, dry and visible.

          <h3>Reflectors</h3>
            <p>
              Being seen can save your life!  It is also required by <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/bike-program/rules-of-the-road" target="_blank">law</a> to have reflectors on your bicycle. Reducing your risk to being found at fault during an accident is another great reason to wear your safety equipment.
